📌 Objective

To analyze historical sales data and build a Machine Learning model that predicts future sales based on various factors such as advertising spend, time period, or product-related features.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains sales-related information such as:

Sales amount (target variable)

Advertising/Marketing spend

Time or date information

Other influencing features (region, product, etc.)

🛠 Tools Used

Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

🔄 Steps Performed

Loaded and explored the sales dataset

Cleaned data and handled missing values

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualized sales trends and relationships

Selected important features

Split data into training and testing sets

Built prediction model using Linear Regression / Random Forest

Evaluated model using MAE, MSE, and R² score

✅ Outcome

Successfully predicted sales with good accuracy

Identified key factors affecting sales

Improved understanding of regression models and business data analysis

Gained hands-on experience in predictive analytics
